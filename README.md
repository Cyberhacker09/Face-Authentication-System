## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Cyberhacker09/Face-Authentication-System.git
cd Face-Authentication-System

2. **Create & activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows


3. **Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**▶️ How to Run**

Simply run the main script:

python main.py

You should see a live webcam window detecting and recognizing faces.

Make sure your webcam is connected and allowed access.

**📦 Dependencies**

All required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. Common ones include:

OpenCV

face-recognition / dlib

numpy

Install them via:

pip install -r requirements.txt

**💡 Usage Tips**

Add new users by capturing their faces and storing in the database folder.

Improve recognition accuracy by adding more images per person.

Make sure lighting is sufficient in the camera capture environment.

**📌 Notes**

This project demonstrates a simple face authentication workflow and can be extended to real apps like:

✔ Attendance systems
✔ Door access control
✔ Secure login mechanisms
